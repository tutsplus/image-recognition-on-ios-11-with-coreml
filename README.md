# [Image Recognition on iOS With CoreML][published url]
## Instructor: [Markus Mühlberger][instructor url]


Machine learning is one of the hottest topics in the tech world right now. It's being used more and more widely for applications such as image, speech and gesture recognition, as well as for natural language processing. With recent advances, it's even possible to run machine learning algorithms on your mobile device. 

In this course, Markus Mühlberger will show you how to put machine learning to work in iOS 11 with Apple's new Core ML library. You'll get an overview of the key machine learning algorithms along with examples of where each one can be applied. You'll learn how to import and convert publicly available models for use with Core ML, and you'll learn how to build an app that applies these models for image recognition. And as a bonus, you'll learn how to build an app that does natural language processing!
